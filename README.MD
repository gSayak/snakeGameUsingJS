Perhaps most importantly, building a snake game using JavaScript is a great way to foster creativity and explore your own ideas. With endless possibilities for customization and enhancement, you can take the basic game mechanics and create something truly unique and innovative.
So whether you're a beginner looking to dip your toes into the world of programming, or an experienced developer looking for a fun side project, building a snake game using JavaScript is sure to inspire and challenge you in new ways.

## What it does
The snake game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats food. The goal of the game is to grow the snake as long as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own tail.
This project involves building a snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.The game will feature a responsive and user-friendly interface that allows the player to control the snake using the arrow keys or swipe gestures on mobile devices. The snake's movement will be controlled using JavaScript logic that updates the position of the snake's head and tail based on the player's input.
The game will also include a scoring system that keeps track of the player's progress and displays their current score and high score. The game will end if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, at which point the player can choose to restart the game and try again.
Overall, this project will result in a fun and challenging game that showcases the power and versatility of JavaScript and demonstrates the principles of game development and interactive design.

## How we built it
To create a snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we followed these basic steps:
<br>**Setting up the project:** We created a new HTML file with a canvas element and added the necessary JavaScript and CSS files. We also defined the initial values for the game variables, such as the starting position and length of the snake, the location of the food, and the score.
<br>**Controlling the snake:** We added event listeners to the document that detect the arrow key or swipe gestures on mobile devices and update the direction of the snake accordingly. We also added logic that ensures the snake cannot turn back on itself or move diagonally.
<br>**Updating the game:** We created a game loop that updates the position of the snake, checks for collisions, and redraws the game board every few milliseconds. We also added logic that increases the length of the snake when it eats food and updates the score accordingly.
<br>**Ending the game:** When the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, we added logic that stops the game loop, displays the player's final score, and gives them the option to restart the game.
Throughout the process, we tested the game frequently and made adjustments as needed to ensure that it was fun, challenging, and easy to use. By the end of the project, we had created a fully functional and engaging snake game using JavaScript and demonstrated the power and versatility of this popular programming language.

## Challenges we ran into
While building the snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we encountered several challenges. Some of the main challenges we faced include:
<br>**Collision detection:** Implementing collision detection between the snake and the walls or the food was a difficult task. We had to carefully calculate the position of the snake and the food and check for overlaps between them. This required a lot of trial and error and careful debugging.
<br>**Controlling the snake:** Creating a smooth and responsive control system for the snake was also a challenge. We had to ensure that the snake moved in a straight line and did not turn back on itself or move diagonally. This required a lot of logic and careful handling of user input.
<br>**Scoring system:** Developing a scoring system that accurately tracked the player's progress and displayed their score and high score was another challenge. We had to ensure that the score updated correctly when the snake ate food and that the high score was saved between game sessions.
<br>**Game loop:** Creating a game loop that updated the position of the snake and the food, checked for collisions, and redrew the game board every few milliseconds was a complex task. We had to ensure that the game loop was efficient and did not cause lag or slow down the game.
<br>**Mobile responsiveness:** Making the game mobile-responsive was also a challenge. We had to ensure that the game controls were intuitive and easy to use on mobile devices, and that the game layout was optimized for smaller screens.
Despite these challenges, we were able to overcome them through careful planning, collaboration, and perseverance. By the end of the project, we had created a fun and engaging snake game that demonstrated the power and versatility of JavaScript and showcased our programming skills.
